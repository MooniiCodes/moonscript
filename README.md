# MoonScript
The language of the future
# MOONSCRIPT HAD A BIG UPDATE!
MoonScript is not based off of JSON anymore and now uses it's own syntax.
# Syntax

Printing

``print "test";``

Variables (Making and setting)

``let "string", "Hello, world!";``

Or getting input

``input ">> ", "string";``

# Notes:

I'm also working on a little modding platform for MoonScript to make/install your own mods.

Also i'll make a repository for people to download these mods with "wowget".
